# Proxmox 6.4 VE

My use case is to test a base install of the following stack:

 1. 3x Dell R620 servers
   * Each: CPU(s) 32 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 0 @ 2.60GHz (2 Sockets)
   * 256 MB Ram
   * 4x 556GB SAAS drives
 2. Proxmox 6.4 VE
 3. ZFS Raid 10
 4. Debian 10 VM
 5. Kubernetes 1.21.0
 6. 3x controller nodes
 7. 4x worker nodes

With a relatively un-tuned system the system is brought to a halt.  The kube
API starts failing with errors related to etcd storage.  Luckily, deleting the
deployment quickly resolves the situation.

```
Error from server: etcdserver: request timed out
```

```
Error from server: etcdserver: leader changed
```

```
Error from server (InternalError): an error on the server ("") has prevented the request from succeeding (get pods fio-c8xm8)
```

# First run

This run, all 7 of the nodes are running on zvols in Proxmox 6.4.  I think this
what's causing the etcd timeouts according to [this
thread](https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/high-disk-io-overhead-for-clients-on-zfs.80151/)
